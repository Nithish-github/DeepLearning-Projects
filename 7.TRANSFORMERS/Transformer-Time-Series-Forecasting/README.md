# Attend All You Need for Time Series Forecasting

This project focuses on implementing an attention-based mechanism for time series forecasting using Transformers. The model is inspired by the architecture used in the paper "Attention is All You Need," adapted for sequential time series data.

The main goal of this project is to leverage the attention mechanism to predict future time steps based on past data in a sequence. By using attention, the model can focus on the most relevant time steps during the prediction phase, making it suitable for handling long sequences in time series forecasting tasks.
